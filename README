MY TOY LINUX DISTRIBUTION
=========================

Here is my toy linux distribution, with a "it works (TM)" pid 1 and a "it works (TM)" shell
which have only repeating functionality.
All of the kernel, pid1 and shell are built for riscv64gc platform and with ilp64d ABI support.

If you know how to use nix, you can run ``nix develop`` and
``qemu-system-riscv64 --nographic -machine virt -kernel $KERNEL_BIN_PATH -initrd $INITRD_PATH``
to have a quick taste on this distribution.
It will build the riscv-gnu-toolchain, so you should at least have 8G empty disk space for the toolchain.

Thanks for popovicu's blog post for teaching me how to build the linux distro:
